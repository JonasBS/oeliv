### DIY Photography Tips:

If shooting yourself:

📱 **Equipment:**
- Modern smartphone (iPhone 12+, Samsung S21+)
- Tripod for stability
- Natural light is your best friend

⏰ **Timing:**
- Shoot during "golden hour" (early morning/late afternoon)
- Overcast days = soft, diffused light (perfect for interiors)
- Avoid harsh midday sun

📐 **Composition:**
- Use rule of thirds

- Include natural elements (plants, flowers, wood)
- Show scale (include a person or familiar object)

🎨 **Styling:**
- Keep it authentic - don't over-stage
- Add fresh flowers/herbs
- Include local products (beer, food)
- Natural materials in frame (linen, wood, ceramics)

   - Room cards: 800x600px
   - Thumbnails: 400x300px

2. **Compress without losing quality:**
   - Use [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com)
